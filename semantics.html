        <h1>My name is Okeowo Moyofade</h1>
        <p>I'm a good listener and I'm always determined to get to wherever I set my goal, I hate sleeping early but I've been doing more than less of that recently and I especially love been surrounded by people.<br> I have lots of goals for this internship starting from when I saw it by chance and applied for it.</p>
          <ol>
             <li> I hope to learn more from being a beginnner to an advanced programmer since most of the the things I know about programming, I read from resources online, I've started learning since when the ASUU strike started not wanting to just stay at home doing nothing. I am determined to be as smart and attentive as I can be. 
            </li>
            <li>
              I also want to have met people at the end of this internship that we can always learn together throughout my journey as a developer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also I have high hopes that I will be more confident about myself as a programmer by the end of this internship.
            </li>
