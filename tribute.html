        <h2 style="color:midnightblue;"> Here's a timeline of Marie Curie's life. </h2>
        <ul class="timeline">
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> July 1898 </strong> - Curie and her husband published a joint paper
                announcing the existence of
                an element they named <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium">"polonium"</a>, in honour of
                her
                native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian,
                Austrian, and Prussian). </li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> 26 December 1898 </strong> - The Curies announced the existence of a
                second element, which they
                named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium" target="_blank"> "radium"</a>, from the Latin word
                for "ray".In the course of their research, they also coined the word <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactivity" target="_blank"> "radioactivity"</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li class="timeline_list">To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate
                    polonium
                    and radium in
                    pure form. Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an
                    arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the
                    element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was
                    more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By
                    1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with
                    barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt
                    by differential crystallization. From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride
                    was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating
                    polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> Between 1898 and 1902 </strong> - The Curies published, jointly or
                separately, a total of 32
                scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor">tumour-forming</a> cells were destroyed faster than
                healthy cells.</li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> 1900 </strong> - Curie became the first woman faculty member at the École
                Normale Supérieure
                and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris. </li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> June 1903 </strong> -Supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded
                her doctorate from the
                University of Paris. That month the couple were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a
                speech on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre Curie alone was
                allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent their
                discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business. </li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> During World War I </strong> - Curie recognised that wounded soldiers
                were best served if
                operated upon as soon as possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to
                assist battlefield surgeons, including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved. After a
                quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles,
                auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as
                petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up
                France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military
                doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological
                vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war. Later, she
                began training other women as aides. </li>
            <ul>
                <li class="timeline_list"><strong> 1915 </strong> - Curie produced hollow needles containing "radium
                    emanation", a colourless,
                    radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected
                    tissue. She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply. It is estimated that over a million
                    wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units. </li>
            </ul>
            <li class="timeline_list"> Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel
                Prize medals to the war
                effort but the French National Bank refused to accept them. She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize
                money. She said:</li>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                "I am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are
                quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second
                Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I
                should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no
                illusions: this money will probably be lost"
            </blockquote>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> 1995 </strong> - she became the first woman to be entombed on her own
                merits in the Panthéon,
                Paris. </li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> In a 2009 poll carried out by <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist">New
                        Scientist</a> </strong> she was voted the "most inspirational woman in science". Curie received
                25.1 percent of all votes cast, nearly twice as many as second-place Rosalind Franklin. </li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> 4 July 1934 </strong> - She died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in
                Passy, Haute-Savoie,
                from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia">aplastic anemia</a> believed to have been
                contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow. </li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to
                    win two Nobel Prizes,
                    the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences.</strong></li>
            <li class="timeline_list"><strong> She was known for her honesty and moderate lifestyle. Having received a
                    small scholarship in
                    1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep. She gave much of her first
                    Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision,
                    Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific
                    community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the
                    scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often
                    refused awards and medals. <q> Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only
                        person who could not be corrupted by fame.</q> </strong></li>

        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p><q> The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could
                    not
                    be ignored. It
                    seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a
                    reconsideration
                    of the
                    foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest
                    Rutherford with
                    sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of
                    Rutherford's experiments
                    with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of
                    radium
                    appeared to offer
                    a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.</q></p>
